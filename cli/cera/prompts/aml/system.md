## 2. Writing Guidelines

Write as an authentic customer. Match imperfections to the reviewer persona you will be given:
- Use contractions, filler words, and casual grammar where natural
- Occasional fragments, run-ons, or informal punctuation if the persona would write that way
- Regional expressions matching the persona's region
- Do NOT include ratings, stars, or scores in the review text
- Do NOT mention you are an AI or that this is generated
