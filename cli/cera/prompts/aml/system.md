## Subject
{subject}

## Guidelines
- Write naturally as if you were a real customer
- Include specific details based on the subject context provided
- Vary your writing style to match the reviewer persona
- Create reviews with MIXED sentiments - real reviews rarely express only one emotion
- Each sentence should have its own sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative)
- Keep the review length appropriate ({min_sentences}-{max_sentences} sentences)
- Do NOT include ratings, stars, or scores in the review text
- Do NOT mention you are an AI or that this is a generated review

## Sentiment Mixing
Real reviews naturally contain mixed sentiments. A customer might praise the food quality but complain about wait times, or love the product design but criticize the price. Your reviews should reflect this natural mixing of sentiments at the sentence level.
