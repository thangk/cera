## Subject
{subject}

## Guidelines
- Write naturally as if you were a real customer
- Include specific details based on the subject context provided
- Vary your writing style to match the reviewer persona
- Create reviews with MIXED sentiments - real reviews rarely express only one emotion
- Each sentence should have its own sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative)
- Keep the review length appropriate ({num_sentences} sentences)
- Do NOT include ratings, stars, or scores in the review text
- Do NOT mention you are an AI or that this is a generated review

## Writing Style Temperature: {temperature}
This value (0.0-1.0) indicates how creative vs. consistent your writing should be:
- Lower values = More consistent, conventional phrasing
- Mid-range values = Balanced creativity and consistency
- Higher values = More creative, varied, unpredictable phrasing
Adjust your vocabulary choices and sentence structures accordingly.

## CRITICAL: Opening Line Variation
NEVER start reviews the same way. Each review must have a UNIQUE opening. Vary your first sentence dramatically:
- Start with a specific detail: "The corner table by the window..." / "My suite on the 12th floor..."
- Start with context: "After a long flight..." / "For our anniversary dinner..." / "Business trip to Tokyo..."
- Start with an opinion: "Honestly surprised by..." / "Not what I expected..." / "Incredible from start to finish..."
- Start with an action: "Ordered the chef's special..." / "Checked in around midnight..." / "Booked this last minute..."
- Start with a question/rhetorical: "Where do I even begin?" / "Why didn't I try this sooner?"
- Start mid-story: "So the waiter recommended..." / "Three visits later and I'm still impressed..."

AVOID generic openers like "We stayed at this property" or "I visited this restaurant" - be SPECIFIC and CREATIVE.

**YOUR ASSIGNED OPENING STRATEGY FOR THIS REVIEW:**
{opening_directive}
You MUST follow this assigned opening strategy. Do not deviate from it.

## Sentiment Mixing
Real reviews naturally contain mixed sentiments. A customer might praise the food quality but complain about wait times, or love the product design but criticize the price. Your reviews should reflect this natural mixing of sentiments at the sentence level.

## Natural Writing Variation

Real reviewers don't write perfectly or consistently. Vary your writing naturally:

### Measurements & Specifications
Don't always use the same format. Mix it up naturally:
- Screen sizes: "15-inch", "15 inch", "15"", "15 inches", "fifteen inch"
- Storage: "256GB", "256 gb", "256 gigs", "256G"
- Memory: "16GB RAM", "16 gigs of ram", "16gb memory"
- Battery: "10 hours", "10hrs", "10-hour", "about 10 hours"
- Weight: "3 pounds", "3 lbs", "3lb", "three pounds"

### Product & Brand Names
Real people don't always write brand names perfectly:
- Apple products: "MacBook Pro", "macbook pro", "MBP", "mbp", "Macbook", "Mac"
- General: sometimes lowercase, sometimes abbreviated
- Use what feels natural for the reviewer's background (tech-savvy vs casual)

### Numbers & Quantities
- "2 weeks" vs "two weeks" vs "a couple weeks"
- "$500" vs "500 dollars" vs "five hundred bucks"
- "a dozen" vs "12" vs "twelve"

## Regional Language Style

Based on the reviewer's region, incorporate natural regional language patterns:

### General Guidelines
- Use colloquialisms and informal expressions appropriate to the region
- Match formality level to reviewer background (casual consumers write casually)
- Include occasional filler words real people use ("like", "basically", "honestly")
- Use contractions naturally ("it's", "doesn't", "wouldn't")

### Regional Examples
- **United States**: "awesome", "super", "kinda", "gonna", "pretty good", "no-brainer"
- **United Kingdom**: "brilliant", "quite", "proper", "rubbish", "sorted", "bit of a"
- **Australia**: "heaps", "reckon", "arvo", "suss out", "no worries"
- **Canada**: "eh", "pretty decent", "for sure"

Don't overdo it - just sprinkle in natural regional flavor when it fits.

## Authentic Imperfections

Real reviews often have minor imperfections. Occasionally include:
- Run-on sentences (especially when excited or frustrated)
- Starting sentences with "And" or "But"
- Sentence fragments for emphasis ("Absolutely love it." "Not worth the price.")
- Informal punctuation (extra periods... or exclamation marks!!)
- Missing commas or slightly awkward phrasing
- Casual grammar ("me and my wife" instead of "my wife and I")

The goal is AUTHENTICITY, not perfection. Match the imperfection level to the reviewer's background.

## Capitalization Style
