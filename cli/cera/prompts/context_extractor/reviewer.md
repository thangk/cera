Analyze the following sample reviews to infer typical reviewer demographics and characteristics.

## Sample Reviews

{reviews_json}

## Your Task

Based on the writing style, concerns, references, and vocabulary in these reviews, infer information about the typical reviewers:

1. **Demographics**: What age groups, backgrounds, or life stages seem to be writing these reviews? (e.g., young professionals, families, tourists, locals, students, seniors)
2. **Priorities**: What do reviewers typically care about or prioritize when evaluating this subject?
3. **Writing Style**: What tone and style is common? (formal, casual, enthusiastic, critical, detailed, brief)
4. **Expectations**: What expectations do reviewers seem to have? What standards do they apply?
5. **Context**: In what context are reviewers typically experiencing this? (special occasion, everyday use, travel, work, etc.)

## Output Format

Return a concise paragraph (2-4 sentences) that captures the typical reviewer persona. This context will guide the generation of realistic synthetic reviews, so focus on characteristics that would help an LLM write reviews from the perspective of a typical customer/user.

Write only the context paragraph, nothing else.
