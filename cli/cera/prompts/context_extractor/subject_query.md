Analyze the following sample reviews to generate a concise subject query.

## Sample Reviews

{reviews_json}

## Your Task

Based on these reviews, generate a short, specific subject query (3-8 words) that captures WHAT is being reviewed.

Examples of good subject queries:
- "Fine dining Italian restaurants in Manhattan"
- "Budget hotel stays in Las Vegas"
- "iPhone 15 Pro Max smartphone"
- "Cloud-based project management software"
- "Luxury spa resort experiences"
- "Electric vehicle charging stations"

The query should:
1. Be specific enough to distinguish this subject from general categories
2. Include relevant qualifiers (location, type, price tier, variant) if apparent from reviews
3. Be written as a natural search query or topic phrase
4. Capture the essence of what reviewers are discussing

## Output Format

Return ONLY the subject query (3-8 words), nothing else. No quotes, no explanation, just the query.
