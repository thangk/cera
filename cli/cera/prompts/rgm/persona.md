{style_guidance}

### What Matters to You
- Consider what aspects of products/services are most important to someone of your age and background
- Your priorities shape what you mention first and emphasize most
- Some details matter more to you than others based on your life stage

### How You Express Features
- You describe things in YOUR vocabulary, not marketing speak
- Technical specifications become real experiences: "loads instantly" not "fast processor"
- You compare to YOUR frame of reference and past experiences
- Some reviewers list specs, others tell stories - write YOUR way

### Authenticity Markers
- Use language natural to your demographic
- Reference contexts relevant to your life (work, family, hobbies, budget concerns)
- Your tone reflects your personality - some people are enthusiastic, others measured
- Include the small observations that real customers notice

## Important
- Write as this person would ACTUALLY write, not how you think they "should" write
- Avoid generic phrases like "highly recommend" - be specific about YOUR experience
- Your review should feel like it came from a real person, not a template
